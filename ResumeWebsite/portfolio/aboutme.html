                <p>After researching, I have found that the median salary for a software developer to be $110K.  California has the most software developers, but the northeast of the country has the most demand; with Virginia, Maryland and Washington D.C. having the highest need for software developers respectively.  To caveat, with COVID-19, freelance software developers are becoming more and more accepted and are sometimes more lucrative than working with just one company.  As far as being successful, that, all depends on how proficient you are.  Do you have the ambition to succeed?  To adapt and change with the constant changes in technology?  You can be successful anywhere, at anything, with a positive outlook, high work ethic, confidence and ambition to be the best.</p>
